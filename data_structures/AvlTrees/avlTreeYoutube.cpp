/*
difference between height of left and right subtree
balance factor 

AVL-tree is a self balancing Binary Search Tree 
Balance Factor is between {-1,0,1} for AVL trees

every AVL-Tree is Binary Search Tree
not every Binary Search Tree is AVL-Tree

Height of a binary search tree of n items:
maximum -> n
minimum -> logn

How Balanced?
The right and left subtrees have the same height 
*Every node must have left and right subtrees of the same height

Balancing operation is updating after every insertion !!
- If the AVL property is violated at a node, the tree must
be re-organized to restore the balance -> The necessary operation is known as a rotation

Rotation Types
-Single
-Double


*Right of rifht --> Single left rotation

Left - Left Imbalance
Right Right Imbalance
Left Right
Right Left
